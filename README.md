# SkipSearch
## Search for food you're craving

### What this is
Lets you search SkipTheDishes for menu items that match your search phrase.

### How to use
Download, `npm install`, and copy the `.env-example` file to `.env` and supply your values.
Then, `node index.js "_searchphrase_"` (ensuring you enclose your multi-word phrase in double quotes.). With any luck, you will receive some results.

### TODO
- Making this a microservice
- Geolocate from a node environment (is this even possible?) or from CLI
- Links to SkipTheDishes for the menu item and restaurant result
